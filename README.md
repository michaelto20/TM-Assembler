### Summary ###
This was a school project for my Theory of Computation class.  We were allowed to pick any language and I had wanted to learn Haskell so I picked it to code the project.  The first few weeks the progress was very slow as I started learning the syntax and how Haskell does pattern matching.  Once I learned that, the progress came quickly.  

There is a source file called "handout" that contains the original assignment.  As a quick recap, I had to program a Turning Machine that could take in a configuration file.  In the file were the instructions for an assembly language that the Turing Machine would run on as well as an algorithm to run.  The user would input a word and the Turing Machine would run the algorithm on the word and output a trace and whether the word was accepted or not by the algorithm.

### How To Get Started ###

1. The following instructions are for a Windows platform
2. Install the Haskell Platform (https://www.haskell.org/platform/)
3. Make sure Haskell is added to your environment variables
4. Go into a command prompt window and navigate to the folder where my Haskell file (Main.hs) is located
5. Type the command “ghc --make Main.hs” without the quotation marks
6. You now have a compiled version of the code
7. Type “Main” without the quotation marks to run the file!
